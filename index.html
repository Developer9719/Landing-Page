                🦊 About HoloLab
                A Creative Studio by One Person With Big Ideas

                Hey there! I'm the one behind HoloLab — a creative studio born from a love of storytelling, stylized visuals, and just a bit of fox magic. Whether it's crafting 3D game assets, building immersive animations, editing sharp video content, or customizing websites with WordPress, I bring ideas to life with a personal touch.
                I specialize in:
                🎮 Game Asset Development (Blender + Unity)
                ✨ 3D Animation and motion graphics (After Effects)
                🧠 Creative Video Editing (Premiere Pro)
                🌐 Custom WordPress Websites (Wordpress)
                🎥 Streaming & content creation (Twitch + OBS)
                What sets me apart? Every project gets the same care as if it were my own — with strong attention to detail, a love for expressive design, and a commitment to making things that feel alive.
                Why the fox?

                Holo, the studio mascot, represents curiosity, cleverness, and a hint of playful rebellion — all qualities I aim to bring to my work. Plus, those tails? Always moving forward.

            Welcome to HoloLab. I’m Justin — and it’s just me here.

            Hey, I’m Justin. I’m the creator and sole employee of HoloLab, a one-person creative studio where imagination, tech, and passion collide.

            I wear all the hats — 3D artist, animator, editor, developer, and sometimes even mascot. I built HoloLab as a space to do what I love: bring stories and ideas to life through visual content, interactive experiences, and motion.

            What I do here:
            🛠 3D Modeling & Animation – From custom characters to stylized environments (Blender + Unity)
            🎮 Game Asset Design – Rigged, ready, and optimized for Unity game projects (Blender)
            🎥 Video Editing & Animation – Music videos, stream intros, and animated content (Premiere Pro + After Effects)
            🌐 WordPress & Web Projects – Simple, clean, custom sites built with visual flair (Wordpress)
            🎙 Content Creation – Twitch, YouTube, and behind-the-scenes creative process (Twitch + OBS)

            Why HoloLab
            The name’s inspired by creativity, curiosity, and a touch of fantasy — traits I channel through every project. Holo, the fox mascot, represents that playful and clever energy that drives my work (and yeah, the tails wag).
            Whether you're here to hire me or just vibing with the fox, thanks for stopping by. Let’s build something cool.
